Risk Assessments are performed and produce information that is only actionable by a governance process.

- This means we can only address big risks and not really small risks.
- This means they dont impact day to day activities which is really what we want from a risk assessment.


- Risk assessments need allow for big decision making but should also inform information gathering and action at a low level because ulitmately we are talking about problems where emergent behaviour is the sum of many activities rather than the impact of a few large actions.  Information should flow to and from the Risk Assessment.
